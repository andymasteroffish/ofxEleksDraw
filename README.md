# ofxEleksDraw
drawing tool that exports g-code for EleksDraw Pen Plotter

You could probably use it with other plotters, but you might need to tweak some of the settings/g-code

Written for oF 0.9.8 but probably works on most any version

You are welcome to try it out, but this is very much a work in progress. Things may be broken or weird.

A fair chunk of code in this project was ported from the Processing VST library by Trammell Hudson
